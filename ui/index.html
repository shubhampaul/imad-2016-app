            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <div>
                Hi. My name is Shubham Paul<br/>
				<hr/>
                Electronics Engineer | Embedded & Networking Hobbyist | Astrophysics Enthusiast | Otaku <br/>
				<hr/>
				I am a jack of 'almost' all trades. I like Electronics and Computers science. I find it fascinating how microprocessors function together with operating systems to create a versatile platform for other hardware and software to leverage it's processing power. I like to work with Embedded systems or anything that includes hardware-software interactions.<br/>

I am a fan of control theory and how it's applied in conjunction with software to mitigate mechanical/electrical design faults or manufacturing defects. I love to see algorithms come to life with electronics and computer science merging inside a mechanical framework to form Robotics.<br/>

I am always quite curious and excited about Astrophysics. Topics like Multi-verse, World Lines and Quantum Physics intrigue me the most.<br/>

I am also keen on researching the 'materialistic' definition of human consciousness, and it's sustainability in an artificial medium.<br/>

And finally, Mathematics; it's present everywhere, it governs everything. It fascinates me with how well it forms the basis of everything, yet it breaks down at the centre of a black hole, a singularity.<br/>

I love Anime, Food and Music! If I start talking about them, this page won't be enough ;-) <br/><br/>
